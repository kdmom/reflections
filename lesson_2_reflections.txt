What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	
	It creates the meta data files needed to store different versions of your repository.   This data is stored in a hidden directory .git. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	Staging area holds changes before commiting them to the repository.  I think it is useful because you can easily back out changes that you may not want to commit to the repository.
