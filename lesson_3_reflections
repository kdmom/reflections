When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
 It would be beneficial if multiple people are working on the same repository, then everyone would have access to all the files.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	I don't always want the changes my colleages are working on downloaded to my local machine.   I want to control what is pulled so I always know the current state of the code on my machine.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Branches are where you would make changes to the code.   Usually done on the local computer.   This is where you can play with the code and test out new ideas without breaking the working code.
	Clones are copies of branches.   Clones contain all the commit history too so you can see different versions of the code as it was being worked.
	Forks are clones done on GitHub.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	You can look at changes others have made before merging your changes in.   It is also good if you need to go offline and can't access GitHub.
